A simple but powerful task manager.

Initial plans were to make this client-side only,
with a simple html file and a text file serving as the "database"
(see [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) for the reasoning),
which would be located in a synchronized folder, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.

This would have made things easier both in the development side
(because it would outsource user account management and file versioning),
and in the user side (because it would eliminate the hassle of creating
Yet Another Account as well as any security concerns associated with that).

Alas, this is not yet possible with client-side code only,
so I am doing this as a server-side app.
There's a demo in the works that can be played with but it won't load or save data;
you would have to host it in a server if you wanted the full functionality.

But don't worry, you're not missing much, since it's in early states
and there are plenty of good apps out there that do much more than Odot does now.
I personally recommend [Checkvist](http://checkvist.com) and [Workflowy](http://workflowy.com).
